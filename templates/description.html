<p>Welcome to the 2024 E4CV Marine Specie Prediction Competition!</p>

<p>The training set consists of <a href="https://fishnet-2023.github.io/">FishNet Dataset</a>. Teams will use this dataset to build computational models to predict specie for test set images. Whether you are working alone or as a team, we welcome researchers, and anyone interested in computational models for specie recognition to participate and submit their results.
